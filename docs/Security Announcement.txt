According to the normal pea-brained IT department policy, all passwords are required to be reset before we exit Earth orbit. Your new passcode must be 4 digits and must contain at least one odd digit, one even digit, one special digit, and one stupid digit. Any non-conforming passwords will be automatically reset to the default code 1234. Thank you for your support in helping to make space a safer place.
