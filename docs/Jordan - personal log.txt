Partial file retrieval: Jordan, commanding officer, pilot, personal log

Day 13. Colonization prep. review with the crew and threat assessment meetings with Maxwell. Filed another protest. It's not right; they don't know what we might be walking into.

Day 37. Today was stasis day. All transitions successful so far. Maxwell and I won't transition until Mission Control decides it's safe. That means we're awake with no scheduled mission tasks. At least Maxwell is a decent card player.

Day 38. The access panel to engineering is glitchy. I re-wired it and set it to the default binary "on off on off" access code. 

Day 44. Seven days of nothing new.

Day 67. Fixed a malfunction in the greenhouse. When we set up on Mars, we'll still have our crops.

Day 83. Still no progress on the device. Maxwell's convinced we can figure it out; he's obsessed with deciphering the symbols.

Day 92. Radar picked up something today. Probably just a glitch.
