SAS - partial file retrieval. Moore, botany officer, personal log

Day 4. Launch was perfect--everything happened just like it was supposed to. Amazing considering we basically use a controlled explosion to lift off.  That's the part this mission I was the most nervous about, so I'm glad we made it. 
 
Day 10. Everything's perfect in the greenhouse, I've just been running routine experiments. It would feel like I'm on vacation if it weren't for the drills Mission Control's been ordering.

Day 133. Systems are failing in the greenhouse for no apparent reason. I'm trying to track down the problem so I'll have something to fix--but I can't find anything. I'm watering manually to keep the plants alive and waiting on authorization to do a complete rebuild. It's the only thing left I can think of to try.
