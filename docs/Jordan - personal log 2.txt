Partial file retrieval: Jordan, commanding officer, pilot, personal log

Day 103. Mission Control reports anomalous satellite imagery near landing site. Nothing conclusive. Rejected my request to inform the rest of the crew.

Day 112. EVA for the antenna array again. Still glitchy.

Day 118: Pulled Graham from stasis today. He'll start computer diagnostics when his "stasis fog" lifts, probably tomorrow.

Day 132. Mission Control might not like it, but I pulled Moore from stasis to make essential repairs. Greenhouse irrigation is down. If he can't handle it, I'll pull Ellis to help him. 

Day 135. Bogey on radar. Not a glitch. Can't get a visual. At least the rest of the crew will be out of stasis soon. I don't like leaving them in those pods when we might be at risk.
