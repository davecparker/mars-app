Partial file retrieval: Graham, systems operations officer, personal log

Day 11. Hey, mom and dad. The mission's going smoothly so far, but it's no big deal--I'm just hurtling through space in a tin can! It's a multi-billion dollar tin can, but still ... 

Maxwell's still a stickler for protocol. I thought when we blasted off he might leave that stick behind, but no such luck.

Day 28. I stand corrected: Maxwell can actually be fun. Last night we played poker in his quarters. Oh, and I saw his code when he opened his door. I thought he'd use something complicated -- I mean the guy's a genius linguist. I'm not sure exactly what I expected, but he just used the last letters of his last name. I tried not to show my disappointment.

Day 35. In a couple days we all go into stasis. I got in my pod the other day to see how it felt. How it felt was creepy, like lying in a coffin.
 
Day 120. The commander pulled me from stasis two days ago; some systems need troubleshooting and repair. What did they do to the Sierra while I was in that freaking coffin? By the way, it does NOT feel good waking up in that thing. 

Ellis gave me an encrypted message on stasis day, but I didn't have enough time to crack it then. I'll try to work on that before they put me under again.
