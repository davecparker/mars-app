SAS - partial file retrieval. Graham, systems operations officer, personal log

Day 11. Hey, mom and dad. The mission's going smoothly so far, but it's no big deal--I'm just hurtling through FREAKING SPACE in a tin can! It's a multi-billion dollar tin can, but still ... 

Maxwell's still a blowhard. I thought when we blasted off he might leave that stick behind, but no such luck.
 
Day 35. In a couple days we all go into stasis. I sat in one of those cryo tanks the other day to see how it felt. How it felt was creepy, like sitting in a coffin.
 
Day 120. The commander pulled me from stasis two days ago; some systems need troubleshooting and repair. What did they do to the Sierra while I was in that freaking coffin? By the way, it does NOT feel good waking up in that thing. 

Ellis gave me an encrypted message on stasis day, but I didn't have enough time to crack it then. I'm gonna work on that before they put me under again.
