SAS - Partial file retrieval: Bridge messages record from Mission Control (MC) and Sierra Automated System (SAS). Retrieval incomplete. Message history follows:
 
MC - Remote status check: Sierra systems optimal.
 
MC - Satellites detect shadows in Sierra's vicinity. Report any unusual activity.
 
MC - Research continuing on the device. No new data to report. Continue research with Dr. Maxwell.

SAS - Antenna array failure. 

MC - Remote status check: Sierra systems optimal.
 
MC - International Space Station non-critical event reported. Unclear if same entities are responsible.
 
MC - Supply drop 18 in progress. Site coordinates to follow.

SAS - Greenhouse power loss.

MC - Remote status check: Greenhouse power fluctuations. 
Directive: Run diagnostics. Repair. Report.

MC - Remote status check: Sierra systems optimal.
 
MC - Systems check due. Pull Graham from stasis for full systems analysis.
 
MC - Satellites detected unknown surface object at coordinates R14.
After establishing base, conduct reconnaissance. Use extreme caution.	
 
MC - Supply drop successful: coordinates Q22.
 
MC - Remote status check: Sierra energy output sub-optimal.
Directive: Pull Ellis from stasis.

MC - Repeat. Sierra energy output sub-optimal.
Directive: Pull Ellis from stasis.
