Partial file retrieval: Webb, geology officer, personal log

=====

Day 1. Aaand we're off! My real work starts when we land on Mars, so as far as I'm concerned, we can't get there fast enough. At least our transit time is decent.  

Day 13. I cut myself today and had to see the doc. Back home, I would just use soap, water, and a bandage, but here, everything has to be documented and disinfected and wrapped up like a war wound.
 
Day 20. Maybe Shaw was right. Mission Control is sending lots of classified messages, and only Jordan is authorized to access them. He's our commanding officer, and we're supposed to be his top priority. I'm trusting he'll let us know if there's anything to worry about, but it's hard to shake the feeling something's just not right.
