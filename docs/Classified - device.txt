SAS - Partial file retrieval:

Classified

The device seems to be alien in origin. This is supported by the discovery location, by the text engraved on one border of the object, and by the fact that we can't scan the thing; nothing penetrates it. It's about 10x6x1", with integrated handles on either end. Most of the surface area, front and back, resemble blank screens. There are no detectable seams or borders, not even where the materials, whatever they are, change. So far, attempts to activate it have been unsuccessful. It's just speculation, but we're hoping that proximity to an alien power source will change that.
