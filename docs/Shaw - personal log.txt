SAS - Partial file retrieval: Shaw, navigation officer, personal log

Day 1. I never feel nervous on missions, but this one's different. We'll be there for a long time; it's not a routine there-and-back mission. 

Day 3. Mission Control's drilling us hard. They're merciless. If they think we need this much additional preparation, they should delay stasis.
