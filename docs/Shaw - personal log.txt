Partial file retrieval: Shaw, navigation officer, personal log

Day 1. I never feel nervous on missions, but this one's different. We'll be there for a long time; it's not a routine there-and-back expedition. We signed on to be the first Martians, so every little thing, even what we eat for breakfast, will end up in history books. That's a lot of scrutiny, and it makes me think twice about everything I do.

Day 3. Mission Control's drilling us hard. They're merciless. If they think we need this much additional preparation, they should delay stasis. Psych may think statis makes for mentally healthier, less stressed astronauts, but I'd rather go the distance conscious.
