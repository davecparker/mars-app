Partial file retrieval: You, medical officer, personal log

Day 13. Today was exciting, I actually had a medical emergency: a minor laceration to Webb's right thumb. I could have just wrapped it up, but I provided the best medical treatment SpaceX can buy. I can't believe Webb put up with it.


Day 30. It seems ridiculous that MC makes us lock our quarters. We know each other better than some of our own family members, we're trapped on a ship hurtling through space, and we trust each other with our lives -- but apparently not with our doors. 

MC's rational is since these will be quasi-permanent quarters once on the surface, they should lock like an apartment would. They say this will maintain an essential sense of personal space, privacy, and normalcy while living on the surface. This reeks of Psych. I told MC that letting a soft science team dictate policy is a mistake. 

With the exception of Jordan and Maxwell, we ignored the door code directive at first (bad astronauts!) and left the default 1234 codes. But after a while we started playing with them. At first we each took a four-digit section of pi, then other number sequences. We used the first four letters of our names. We even used a Romper Room-simple variation on the default code: 1234, 2345, 3456, etc. 

The best one was when we used our birthdays, and who ever could remember the most birthdays and open the most doors by dinner that night won extra dessert rations. I came in second. Graham beat me out by one code. Most of us now know everyone's birthdays. We tried setting all the pads to the same code to see if the system would allow it. It didn't. Once we changed the initial default, the system disallowed uniform codes. 

For stasis, we're all using birthdays so we don't have to worry about memorizing codes. We're not sure how disoriented we'll be when we wake up.
