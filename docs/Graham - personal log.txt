SAS - Partial file retrieval: Graham, systems operations officer, personal log

Day 1. Launch went without a hitch. I hope the rest of the trip is that smooth. Should be--launch is the trickiest part. 

Day 3. I knew it was going to be hard leaving my family behind, but this feels brutal. At least when we land I can say happy birthday to Brian from Mars. What 12-year-old wouldn't love that? I scheduled my terminal to alert me. We just count days while in transit, then on Mars we'll count sols, so I'd probably miss January 22nd without a reminder.
