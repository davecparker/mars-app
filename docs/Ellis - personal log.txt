SAS - Partial file retrieval: Ellis, engineering officer, personal log

Day 5. I thought this would be the most exciting mission of my career, but it's the strangest. Mission Control still has me reconfiguring tools for "alternate uses," like I don't know weapons systems when I see them. We're establishing the first settlement on Mars, not going into battle. I thought the drills would ease up once we were on our way. 

Day 13. Jordan's stressed. And angry. He won't admit it, but I can see it. I think we all can. It's making us all feel on edge. 

Day 36. I got an encrypted message. I don't know who sent it, and I can't crack it. Stasis is tomorrow, so I don't have much time. I'll go to Graham with it first thing in the morning.
