Partial file retrieval: Shaw, navigation officer, personal log

=====

Day 13. The mission's been perfect so far, and we're on the Sierra--the best ship ever made--so I feel paranoid saying this: something's not right up here.  We should all be happy, but everyone's tense, especially Jordan and Maxwell. It doesn't make sense. I've never had a mission feel like this before.

Day 37. Ugh, stasis. I'd rather stay conscious, but at least it'll make the trip seem faster. I can't wait to get there. As soon as we're set up, I'm taking the rover out for a spin!

Day 37 (2). Jordan and Maxwell are delaying stasis--for them--and won't say anything except that it's a new Mission Control directive. I know some things are classified, but it doesn't feel right going into stasis not knowing why. Our lives are in each other's hands, and that doesn't seem like a good thing any more.
