Day 5. It's only been a few days, and the crew is already finding new ways to entertain themselves. They're dealing with the mandatory quarters code policy by sharing and swapping codes. I don't know what Psych was thinking; on this ship, the trust the crew has in each other is more important than the privacy a keypad offers. I was worried about how the policy would affect morale, but they reacted to the implication that they can't trust each other with humor. This is a great crew, and I know they'll handle the prolonged surface mission like pros. They're the best of the best and they prove it every day.

Day 12. Jordan and I continue to work on the object, but we're still at the same dead end. The symbols can't be deciphered in isolation, and there's no apparent way to open it or activate it. The potential for spontaneous energy source activation on the surface is a longshot. But when everything else fails, longshots start to look good.

Day 37. Stasis day. I agree with Jordan, but orders are orders. 

Day 42. SpaceX sent images that look like a match for the unknown symbols on the device. The language doesn't seem to be either purely glyph or character based. I suspect it's a combined system, but it's too early to be sure. The linguistics team should be sending a first round status report on their efforts soon. 

Day 82. Jordan's keeping his quarters door code to himself. He has classified materials to protect, even with the crew in stasis. I'm betting his current code is either the Euler-Mascheroni constant or a Mars sol's hours and minutes.
