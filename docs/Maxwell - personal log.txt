Day 12. Jordan and I continued work on the object, but we've hit a dead end. The symbols can't be deciphered in isolation, and there's no apparent way to open it or activate it. The potential for spontaneous energy source activation on the surface is a longshot. When everything else fails, longshots start to look good.

Day 37. Stasis day. I agree with Jordan, but orders are orders. 

Day 42. SpaceX sent images that look like a match for the unknown symbols on the device. The language doesn't seem to be either purely glyph or character based. I suspect it's a combined system, but it's too early to be sure. The linguistics team should be sending a first round status report on their efforts soon. 

Day 82. Jordan's keeping his quarters locked. He has classified materials to protect, even with the crew in stasis. I'm betting his current code is either the Euler-Mascheroni constant or a Mars sol's hours and minutes.
